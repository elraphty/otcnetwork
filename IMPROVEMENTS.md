## WHAT I MISSED

The first 2 points
"
  * Each server would own a copy of the orderbook.
  * Each server can make a call to another server with an order ($50,000/1BTC)
"

I was not really sure if point 1 means each server should have individual storage that will be in sync with other servers storage

Point 2 also stated thaat each server can make and receove a call to another server, it's my first time using grenache grapes so I was not so such if the server can also send a request to the client to respond with a reply

## IMPROVEMENTS

- Make the return order value return a forward slash (/) instead of a special character
